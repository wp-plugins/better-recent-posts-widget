If youâ€™ve ever wanted more control (a lot more control) over displaying your recent posts, this is the widget for you. Plus thumbnails. Glorious, wonderful thumbnails.

== Description ==

If you've ever wanted to display recent posts, but go far beyond the Recent Posts widget that comes with WordPress, you're in the right place. 

One of the very best ways to increase time-on-site (and therefore the engagement of you audience) is helping visitors discover new and wonderful pages and posts on your site. Better Recent Posts Widget can do that, but displaying your beautiful featured images right in the widget. You can control the number of posts to display, specify if you want to skip some posts, and display custom post types.
