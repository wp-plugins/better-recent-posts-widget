This plugin lets provides a much better recent posts widget, including thumbnails

== Description ==

WordPress comes with a Recent Posts widget that you can use to display a list of your latest posts in your widgetized sidebar, but it is really not very good in the fact that it does give you any control over your posts at all. So I have written a new one.

This is a very simple plugin, but it gives you much better control over your widget display.

Also includes ability to display recent custom post types

== Features ==

1. New Recent Posts Widget
2. Widget Title Option
3. Option to control the number of posts displayed
4. Option to control the posts offset
5. Ability to enable post thumbnails
6. Thumbnail size option
7. Choose the post type to display

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'recent-posts-widget' folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
